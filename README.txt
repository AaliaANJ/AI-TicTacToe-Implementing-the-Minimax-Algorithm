
**Name:** Aalia Anjum

- **Project Title:**  
  Artificial Intelligence Tic-Tac-Toe

- **Description:**  
  The following is my first attempt at coding an AI.  
  This program creates a GUI for the game Tic-Tac-Toe using the Tkinter Python package.  
  There are two game modes players can choose from: "Play with Human" and "Play with AI."  
  The latter implements the Minimax algorithm to recursively check and place the most optimal move on the board while considering the board state.

- **Installation:**  
  Download the entire program file and run the `.py` file on Python IDLE or another alternative.

- **Usage:**  
  A GUI title screen will open when the file is run. Click on the game mode you would like to play.

  If you click "Play with Human," you will be able to play Tic-Tac-Toe by clicking the 3x3 grid to place an X or O.  
  You may reset the game by clicking the reset button at the bottom of the screen.  
  You may return to the home page by clicking the home button at the bottom of the screen.  
  The starting player will alternate if the restart button is pressed.

  If you click "Play with AI," the same game mechanics apply. However, the second player is automated and uses the Minimax  function to recursively check the best set of moves to play depending on the board state. Theoretically, it should be impossible for the human player to win the game. The human player may only reach a draw or lose when playing against the AI.

- **Features:**  
  1. Tkinter Python package  
  2. Minimax AI implementation  
  3. Multiple game modes  
  4. Interactive GUI user interface
